!
! DO NOT CHANGE THE PARAMETER NAMES! INTEGERS are limited to 6 digits! 
!
!
! "," is a separator, IMPORTANT: ",4" will be read as two numbers, "0" and "4"
! "." is the decimal point
!  
! parameter description (name) must not change including no adding extra spaces between words! 
! 
! the parameter description ends with  "=" whish is followed by the parameter value
! 
! the program will ignore all lines that start with "!" in the first column

! Model threshholds: The order in which the models are envoked are 
! 1) the Boltzmann equation, non-split formulation 
! 2) the Boltzmann equation, split f=f_M + df, formulation
! 3) the linearized Boltzmann equation (unless solving spatially homogeneous problem, does not give an advantage)
! 4) the BGK-type Model with velocity dependent collision frequency
! 5) the ES-BGK/BGK or Shakhov model
! 
! the parameters below define the thresholds for switching between models. They represent the maximum allowed values of the L1-norm of the 
! deviation of the solution from the local maxwellian. When the L1-norm of the deviation drops below the treshhold, the appropriate model is envoked. 
! NOTICE: keep linear_lev at least an order of magnitude less than decomp_lev
!
! VERY IMPORTANT: the tresholds for the models above should be given in decreasing order. 
! Otherwise the algorithms will make a mistake.
