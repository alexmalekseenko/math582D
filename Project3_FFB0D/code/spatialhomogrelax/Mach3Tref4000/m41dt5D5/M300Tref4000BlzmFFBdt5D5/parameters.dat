!
! DO NOT CHANGE THE PARAMETER NAMES! INTEGERS are limited to 6 digits! 
!
!
! "," is a separator, IMPORTANT: ",4" will be read as two numbers, "0" and "4"
! "." is the decimal point
!  
! parameter description (name) must not change including no adding extra spaces between words! 
! 
! the parameter description ends with  "=" whish is followed by the parameter value
! 
! the program will ignore all lines that start with "!"

! choose from different kinds of boundary conditions: 
! 1 - periodic BCs
! 2 - exact BCs (will need to know the selected exact solution
! 3 - diffusive reflection BCs. 
!

! select the type of boundary conditions 
conditions on the left boundary = 3    !! selected_leftbcond 
conditions on the right boundary = 3   !! selected_rightbcond 

! choose from different kinds of exact solutions: 
! 1 - sin(x+u) -- type of source
! 2 - ext(-1/x^2) -- type of source  
! 3 - diffusion BCs

! Select the exact solution
! 1 = "f(ut-nx+cu)", f(x)=a*\exp(-b/((x-r_1)(x-r_2))) zero right side exact solution (or 1a = 1- cos(x) periodic wave) 
! 1(a) = "f(ut-nx+cu)", f(x)=1-cos(2\alpha\pi x) zero right side exact solution
! 2 =  maxwelveldist (T1,u1,u)*N1 + maxwelveldist (T2,u2,u)*(1-N1) --- mimic shock wave bimodal distribution (time independent)
!      function sf_02 only makes sense for initial data. Error is replaced by L_2 norm

type of exact solution = 2        !! selected_exact_sol

! directory and the base name for the solution
!

current solution save directory = sol080909/ !! needs a comment, otherwise includes CR in the name
current solution base name = M300Trf4dt5D5_ !!

! Parameters of time evolution 
!

initial time = 0.0  !! beginning value of time (t_L) 
final time = 0.1045    !! final value of time (t_R) (USC Mach 10: 0.00025
time step = 0.00005  !! value of the time step dt

instances to evaluate error = 800 !! num_eval_error = how many (evenly spaced in time) evaluations of error
instances to save solution =  60  !! num_save_sol = how many times the solution (and error and other quantities) is saved during the evolution

! Parameters related to non-unifom mesh generation
type of nonuniform mesh in x = 2 ! x_nonuniform_mesh_type

! supported types of nonuminform mesh:
! For variable u:
! 1 --- the mesh is build based on the gauss nodes used for the integration of moments, moments_x_gauss_nodes and 
!       moments_u_gauss_nodes. intervals [x_left,x_right], [u_left,u_right] is divided in subintervals 
!       as to have gauss nodes at centerpoints. Some extra points need to be introduced to make this possible.
! 2 --- this mesh is to be used with the diffusive boundary conditions. The velocity of the wall (currently only u_{w}=0)
!       will be included in the mesh. Also, the cell near the walls will be 1/8 - 1/4 - 1/2        
! 3 --  for variable u -- this mesh will have small cells surrounding u=0 as prescribed by parameters
!       sml -- small cell levels amd smr -- small cell refinement factor 
! 3 --- This is a non-uniform mesh in "x" with cells near wall be 1/4-1/2. Currenlty is not supported for meshes in "u"


! Parameters related to the integration of moments

gauss order for moments in x  = 5    ! moments_x_gauss_order
mesh refinement in x for moments = 1 ! moments_refine_x 

! Parameters of diffusive BCs -- only used with diffusive BCs

temperature of the left wall = 1.0   ! T_w_left -- temperature of the wall on the left
temperature of the right wall = 3.0  ! T_w_right -- temperature of the wall on the right

! Restart of the solution

solution restart = no      ! need_to_restart yes to restart
restart time = 0.0120000000  ! restart_time_txt restart/last saved solution time in text format --- use the exact numbers from the filename!

! OpenMP parameters: 
number of OMP threads = 28 ! Num_OMP_threads -- this variable is duplicated in the DGV-library --- be careful...
