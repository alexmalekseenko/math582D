! choose from different kinds of boundary conditions: 
! 1 - periodic BCs
! 2 - exact BCs (will need to know the selected exact soluiton
! 3 - diffusive reflection BCs. 
!

! select the type of boundary conditions 
conditions on the left boundary = 2    ! selected_leftbcond

! choose from different kinds of exact solutions:

! 3 - diffusion BCs

! Select the exact solution

! Parameters of time evolution

initial time = 0.0  ! beginning value of  (time) 
final time = 0.1  ! final value of time (USC Mach 10: 0.00025
time step = 0.00005 ! value of the time step (depends on dx! and rk!)

! Parameters related to Non-unifom mesh generation
type of nonuniform mesh in x = 2 ! x_nonuniform_mesh_type
type of nonuniform mesh in u = 3 ! u_nonuniform_mesh_type

! supported types of nonuminform mesh:
! For variable u:
! 1 --- the mesh is build based on the gauss nodes used for the integration of moments, moments_x_gauss_nodes and 
!       moments_u_gauss_nodes. intervals [x_left,x_right], [u_left,u_right] is divided in subintervals 
!       as to have gauss nodes at centerpoints. Some extra points need to be introduced to make this possible.
! 2 --- this mesh is to be used with the diffusive boundary conditions. The velocity of the wall (currently only u_{w}=0)
!       will be included in the mesh. Also, the cell near the walls will be 1/8 - 1/4 - 1/2        
! 3 --  for variable u -- this mesh will have small cells surrounding u=0 as prescribed by parameters
!       sml -- small cell levels amd smr -- small cell refinement factor 
! 3 --- This is a non-niform mesh in "x" with cells near wall be 1/4-1/2. Currenlty is not supported for meshes in "u"


! Parameters related to the integration of moments
