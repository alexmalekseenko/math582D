type of nonuniform mesh in v = 3 ! v_nonuniform_mesh_type
type of nonuniform mesh in w = 3 ! w_nonuniform_mesh_type

! supported types of nonuminform mesh:
! For variable u:
! 1 --- the mesh is build based on the gauss nodes used for the integration of moments, moments_x_gauss_nodes and 
!       moments_u_gauss_nodes. intervals [x_left,x_right], [u_left,u_right] is divided in subintervals 
!       as to have gauss nodes at centerpoints. Some extra points need to be introduced to make this possible.
! 2 --- this mesh is to be used with the diffusive boundary conditions. The velocity of the wall (currently only u_{w}=0)
!       will be included in the mesh. Also, the cell near the walls will be 1/8 - 1/4 - 1/2        
! 3 --  for variable u -- this mesh will have small cells surrounding u=0 as prescribed by parameters
!       sml -- small cell levels amd smr -- small cell refinement factor 
! 3 --- This is a non-niform mesh in "x" with cells near wall be 1/4-1/2. Currenlty is not supported for meshes in "u"

! Parameters of Calculating the A-array:

! OpenMP parameters: 
number of OMP threads = 1  ! Num_OMP_threads
!MPI parameters
number of procs for linear problem = 4 ! num_lin_proc  -- this is the number of processors dedicated to the evaluation of the linearized collision operator
no update linearization steps wait = 3  ! num_linstep_wait >1  -- this is the number of steps that the program will wait untill envoking the groupd of processors for linearized problem
                                    ! by default, the linearized solution is computed on slave processors. however
                                    ! if the linearized operator has not been uptaded #num_linstep_wait# times, then 
                                    ! we will send chunks of the linearized operator to a selected group of processors and will try to compute it there
                                    ! presumably, we can save on communication by doing that. 
number of mpi copies of A = 1       ! num_Acopies -- this is to keep the number of copies of A distributed between the MPI processors.

! Linearization and Decomposition parameters: 
! these are parameters that tell when the decomposition or linearization

! for deviations from a maxwellian in L_1 or other norm. 
! NOTICE: keep linear_lev at least an order of magnitude less than decomp_lev
